  "summary": "Global CSS tokens for `--foreground` were updated to white in both `frontend/src/index.css` and `frontend/index.css`, and several components were adjusted to use `text-foreground`/white hover states. However, the diff does not fully ensure that all explicitly non-white text utility classes (e.g., `text-green-accent`, `text-gold`, `text-black`, and icon colors like `text-primary`) render as white across the app, so REQ-2 appears only partially implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure all user-visible text remains white even where components currently apply explicit non-white text utility classes (e.g., `text-muted-foreground`, `text-primary`, `hover:text-primary`, `text-green-accent`, `text-gold`), including interactive states such as hover and focus.",
      "reason": "The diff shows custom classes like `.text-green-accent` and `.text-gold` still mapped to the primary (yellow) token, and there are still explicit non-white text utilities in use (e.g., `text-green-accent`, `text-black`, and an icon using `text-primary`), which contradicts the requirement that all user-visible text remain white (including accents/hover states).",
